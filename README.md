# BitFabRust


## To Do
- [] make strea_id unique so that boradcast_to_peers can work
- [x] Move router to sever struct
- [x] Implment the handle_connection in server struct
- [x] Implement the connect_to_peer in server struct

The reason to do them is that we need to access them from the router closures
